# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Simulator
A game made with pygame that allows a user to simulate playing Rock Paper Scissors with a computer. To play, simply download the project folder, extract the files, install the libraries mentioned at the top of the "rps.py" file, and run the "rps.py" file, which will open up a game window. You can then press start and begin playing by choosing the rock, paper, or scissors button. After each round, press the space bar to restart or the window exit button to stop. 

## Tools Used
- **Python** - language used to write the code for this project.
- **Pygame** - Python library used to create the user interface.

## Possible Project Extensions
In the future, I plan to improve this project by implementing a machine learning model that analyzes the pattern of the user's choices and tries to make logical decisions so that the game is more realistic. 

## Hand Animation 
For the hand animations in the game screen, I used this gif to get the images used in the sprites list: https://gfycat.com/whichdisastrousamurratsnake.
